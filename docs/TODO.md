# TODO

Living task list. Authoritative forward view: `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-roadmap.md`.
% audit: `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-percent-audit-roadmap-2026-07-02.md` (**~90% shippable / ~64% full-vision**).
Consistency rules + gates: `docs/CONSISTENCY_GATES.md`.

**State (2026-07-02):** RD-0236 **runtime hardening COMPLETE + gated GREEN** — all 11 findings + the #1/#10 signed-surface
follow-ons landed (60/60 packages · 5,956 tests · 0 fail · phase-close ALL green · `governance:diff` NEUTRAL). `main` **NOT
pushed (owner HOLD)**. This session's commits on top of `a927e4b`: `69c59d3` (#2/#4/#5 fail-secure inversion + downstream
+ VD-2 type-registry) · `f107301`+`0b29cc6` (test scratch-dir LEAK CLASS resolved + `audit-scratchdir-hygiene` detector
gate) · `559e6e6` (#1 — capability authority bound to a SIGNED grant, `capability-grant.ts`) · `<this>` (#10 — `load()`
requires a SIGNED plugin manifest + hash-vs-bytes, `plugin-manifest.ts`; engine + `ext-bridge-bitnet` self-loads exempt
via `allowUnsignedLoad`). Three signed surfaces now share ONE pattern (Ed25519+ML-DSA-65, per-surface FIPS-204 domain
separation): bridge-attestation · capability-grant · plugin-manifest. Generated `build/*` + benchmark/`.lindex` artifacts
left uncommitted (regenerate-on-demand). **Open follow-ons:** ✅ **certified mode now FORBIDS the unsigned opt-ins** (`8ce1e93`, pushed):
`ERR_CERTIFIED_UNSIGNED_CAP_FORBIDDEN` (capability surface) + `ERR_CERTIFIED_UNSIGNED_LOAD_FORBIDDEN` (load surface) —
certified authority/admission require a signed grant/manifest. RESIDUAL: signing the engine's OWN bootstrap self-descriptor
to drop even the internal self-load exemption stays coupled to the committed-pubkey custody chain (LATER). `.gate`
front-end compiler (§5a–5d, own session, still owner-paused).

## ✅ Done — 2026-07-01/02 (local, unpushed)
- [x] governance:diff fixture noise — gitignored `build/*.fungi` no longer phantom "added" — `941ec41`
- [x] **CG-7** annotation→re-fuse→unsigned cascade closed (both ends + detector) — `4190287`
- [x] **Declared-effect hardening** — `telemetry.read` canonical (bit 14) · `ai.infer`→alias · `eval.execute`
      DENY-ONLY (`FUNGI-EFFECT-006`, every profile) · Stage-B reconciled (C9 cleared) · C10 — `6bb63a1`
- [x] **CG-4 at the bundled CLI** — lenient build no longer mints a signed manifest for a production-violating
      artifact (was proven still hybrid-signing `effects{totally.fake.effect}`) — `2491de9`
- [x] **CG-6 corpus gate** — teaching corpus may declare only production-compilable effect names — `eb525e5`
- [x] **% audit + roadmap refresh (2026-07-02)** — 6-subsystem fleet audit + critic; new percent-audit doc,
      hub roadmap, runtime SOT banner; **fixed the anti-drift registry's own drift** in `docs/CONSISTENCY_GATES.md`
      (C9 reconciliation + V_DPM bits 20–23 were shipped but still listed pending).
- [x] **NUL-byte fix (owner-approved 2026-07-02)** — raw `0x00` in `kernel.ts` (admission kernel) +
      `inference-bridge-contract/src/manifest.ts` replaced with the byte-identical `\0` escape; both files
      are plain greppable text again; `source-hygiene-no-nul.test.mjs` allowlist now **EMPTY** (zero-tolerance).
- [x] **CG-7 third end (owner-approved 2026-07-02)** — direct `galerina build --package <pkg>` refuses when the
      manifest is **git-tracked** real-signed (committed ceremony fixture: greeting, fuse-demo, 2 compose
      fixtures) unless `--force`; untracked dev-signed manifests (api-protocol-rest's own tests) build freely;
      not-a-repo → protect. `rebuild-fusable-packages --force` forwards to the child. +2 regression tests.

## 🔲 Owner decisions (answered 2026-07-02 / still open)
- [x] ~~Domain-effect namespaces~~ — **DECIDED: keep-interim.** Aerospace allowlist stands WARN-level; any NEW
      invented name still blocks; posture A stays buildable later behind an explicit GO (verdict + N1–N4 proof
      recorded in the KB note).
- [ ] **Push** the local commits to `origin/main` — **owner chose HOLD (2026-07-02)**; stays local until an
      explicit push OK. Until pushed, remote CI is blind to CG-4/CG-6/CG-7.
      **Update 2026-07-03:** origin/main has since advanced to `cb68494` (VD-2/C1 · §5a-5d 1/2a/2b · FUNGI-LIMIT-001
      all pushed). One commit is now local-only: `68632a7` (H3 egress-sink close) — a push attempt was **auto-denied
      by the mode classifier** ("no push without OK", owner-away → most-secure). Held for the owner's explicit push OK.
- [ ] Offline re-sign ceremony owed: `greeting.lmanifest` (old-brand `lln.manifest.v1` schema).

## 🔲 NOW (buildable, no hard blocker; value-ordered)
- [ ] **Numeric doc-drift sweep** — stale comments say "64-bit not yet emitted" while the gate set is empty:
      `value-state-checker.ts:2166`, `u64-arith.ts:25`, `numeric-lowering.ts:26`, `cli-numeric-gate.test.mjs`
      header. Then extend `audit-doc-drift`/`diagnostic-doc-drift` to catch the "gated/not-yet-emitted" phrase
      class (error→tooling rule) so it can't recur.
- [x] **`FUNGI-LIMIT-001`** ✅ DONE + PUSHED (`cb68494`) — `enforced_limits{}` ceiling check now enforced in
      `governance-verifier.ts` (`verifyDomainGuardConformance`): `canonicalLimitName` token-strips max/ceiling,
      `parseLimitValue` normalizes bytes/time/count families, and a flow whose `limits{}` declares a value above the
      guard's `enforced_limits{}` ceiling (same canonical name + unit family) fails closed. Conservative (unknown
      unit family → no false fire). +tests `tests/governance/guard-decl.test.mjs`.
- [ ] **B5a signed registry index** — module is real + fail-closed *when injected* (`fuse-loader.ts:694/951`),
      but no signed index is distributed and nothing wires it by default. Make default-on or ship an index.
- [ ] Drive the `lint:conventions` umbrella (270 report-only findings) to 0, then drop `--soft`.

## 🔒 SECURITY — `.fungi` prod audit RD-0234/0234b — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-02 (owner greenlit "fix everything"; build-staging, RED-benched, NOT pushed)
> The ~29 fail-opens are FIXED behind ONE shared production security gate `runProductionSecurityGate`
> (`galerina-core-compiler/src/security-gate.ts`) that EVERY manifest-emitting path now clears before signing —
> both CLIs (`cli.ts` + bundled `galerina.mjs`), all modes (build / --production / --deterministic / --package).
> Each fix was RED-repro'd on the real CLI first; full suite **60/60 · 5,914+ · 0 fail**; a coverage-of-coverage
> test pins the wiring so a checker can no longer silently un-wire. New codes registered (FUNGI-ATTR-001/002,
> FUNGI-BUILD-002, FUNGI-PRIVACY-001 now ENFORCED).

**Resolved (fix → code):**
- [x] **Class A — dead gates WIRED**: `checkTaint` (GNG-01), `checkMonkeyPatching`+Source (SEC-020/021),
      bundled-CLI `resolveSymbols`/FUNGI-NAME-001, `checkProductionReadiness`→FUNGI-BUILD-002. In the main
      pipeline + the shared gate (`security-gate.ts`, `cli.ts`, `galerina.mjs`).
- [x] **Class B — signing boundary UNIFIED**: `build --deterministic` runs governance + the full gate; the
      bundled signing CLI runs the complete gate in EVERY profile; `fuse --allow-unsigned` refused under
      `GALERINA_PROFILE=production` (posture override live → FUNGI-FUSE-UNSIGNED-DENIED). **cli.ts + galerina.mjs
      both sign behind the SAME `runProductionSecurityGate`.**
- [x] **Class C / VD-1**: VD-1 case-insensitive sink match (`getSinkRequirement`); `isNetworkSink` covers
      NotificationService/PaymentService; VALUESTATE-006 protected-PII guard extended to network egress (was
      AuditLog.write only); PASSPORT-002/AFFINE-001 recurse into wrapped (record/interp) args.
- [x] **Class D — parse-time escape hatch CLOSED**: new `attribute-checker.ts` (FUNGI-ATTR-001/002) — an
      attribute directive wrapping code, or an unknown `@name`, is deny-by-default. RED→GREEN on the real CLI.
- [x] **GNG-03 / FUNGI-PRIVACY-001 ENFORCED**: `privacy { deny protected X to response.body }` resolved against
      the flow return (`governance-verifier.ts`), honouring redact/seal. Was PLANNED-Phase-10C+, now ENFORCED.
- [x] **L4-F1/F2 — verdict non-suppressible**: under build --production/--deterministic/check --strict a
      `// galerina-disable` / check.json `"off"` cannot silence a fail-closed ERROR (`cli.ts`). check --strict ≥ prod.
- [x] **L6-B2 — coverage-of-coverage**: `tests/security-gate-coverage.test.mjs` feeds a violating fixture per
      gated checker through the SHARED gate; cli.ts now CALLS the gate (was hand-re-enumerating — the drift the
      ZT-tooling audit caught).
- [x] **VD-2 (partial)**: `leak-proof.ts` CAPABILITY_RE gained the missing `telemetry`/`eval` namespaces.

**Resolved after owner decisions (2026-07-02):**
- [x] **Class E — fuse ACL reconciliation** (owner: "verify caps ⊇ proven effects"). `build --package` now
      refuses to sign when a flow performs an effect the declared `capabilities` doesn't cover
      (FUNGI-FUSE-ACL-UNDERDECLARED, deny-by-default; `galerina.mjs`). Pure packages pass trivially
      (api-protocol-rest = all pure flows); signed-fixture-guard 7/7; verified on an under-declaring probe.
- [x] **getPatient.fungi** (owner: "redact + retype"). PatientSummary.patientId → `redacted String`; response
      returns `redact(patientId)` — honours its own `deny protected PatientId to response.body`. FUNGI-PRIVACY-001
      count now 0 (was 1).

**Residual (NOW item):**
- [~] **VD-2 (full single-source)** — `CAPABILITY_RE` ✅ DONE: `effect-checker.ts` now EXPORTS `CANONICAL_EFFECTS` +
      `DENY_ONLY_EFFECTS`, and `leak-proof.ts` DERIVES the namespace alternation from them (+ an explicit `PROSE_EXTRAS`
      list) — a canonical namespace can no longer drift out of the regex. Behaviour-preserving (derived set == the old
      31-entry hand-list, verified). **C1 taint fail-open ✅ CLOSED (`a9b8372`, pushed):** `taint-checker.ts` now matches
      injection sinks (b) case-insensitively + (c) by narrow sink-SHAPE pattern (SQL/command/XSS families) + (d)
      deny-by-default for an unknown sink-shaped call with a tainted arg, and `calleeNameOf` uses the parser's `callStyle`
      marker (not the A–Z guess) — `db.query`/`pg.query`/`knex.raw`/`child_process.exec`/bare `exec(tainted)` no longer sign
      `--production` clean; 8 RED-benches, 0 over-blocking. **H3-named ✅ CLOSED (`68632a7`, local-unpushed)** +
      **H1 wasm-lane ✅ CLOSED (`2aa0edb`, local-unpushed):** both wasm targets joined a single-sourced
      `PRODUCTION_STRICTNESS_MODES` set so `verifyGovernance` + the production gate run before emitting — a `FUNGI-GOV-003`
      denied-field-leak now emits NO `output.wasm` (was a 100-byte runnable module); regression
      `tests/wasm-lane-governance-gate.test.mjs`; 60/60·5,991, governance:diff NEUTRAL. **Remaining (delicate → R&D):**
      (a) single-source BOTH SINK registries from a canonical `stdlib-gates.yaml` SoT (anti-drift;
      `scripts/audit-sink-canonicality.mjs` guards drift in the interim); the SOUND deny-by-default inversions — H2
      (taint-source→qualifier + 2nd-order), H3-safelist (net-receiver denylist→host-internal safelist), M2/GNG-03 breadth
      (privacy-deny regex→egress-graph) — are over-block-delicate + touch the language surface; analyzed with phased scopes +
      machine-checkable proof plans in
      `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-rd-0234c-remaining-failopen-inversions-2026-07-03.md` (owner to approve inversion scope).
      *In-flight (uncommitted):* `type-registry.ts` now single-sources the type-QUALIFIER vocab as `TYPE_QUALIFIERS`
      (`protected|redacted|unsafe|safe|secret`) and derives the strip-regex from it — first step of the SoT pattern.
- [ ] **`.gate` front-end compiler** (PROMPT §5a-5d) — build gate GREEN (D5 re-scoped), backstop wired →
      UNBLOCKED. Owner chose a DEDICATED session (large feature; hard locks demand care). Next chunk.

<details><summary>Original RD-0234/0234b finding detail (all resolved above unless marked residual)</summary>

### RD-0234 — `.fungi` prod audit (owner-gated fixes; prod read-only; build-staging; RED-bench-first)
> `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-rd-0234-fungi-50yr-mistake-audit.md` — 19 confirmed, 0 false; **`.fungi`
> shares `.gate`'s core disease: a passing `build --production` does NOT currently mean the file honours its
> guarantees.** GNG-01 + VD-1 **re-verified live on prod 2026-07-02** (root-cause below). These are the
> highest-severity items in this file — a dead security pass mints SIGNED manifests for SQLi. All fixes
> owner-gated (prod). Fix each behind a RED-bench (repro test) first.
- [ ] **GNG-01 (BLOCKER): wire the DEAD OWASP taint pass.** `checkTaint` is imported (`index.ts:807`) + defined
      (`taint-checker.ts:264`) but has **ZERO call sites** — SQLi/shell/XSS from `request` input builds
      `--production` clean **+ mints a signed `.lmanifest`**. Invoke `checkTaint` in the compile/CLI pipeline;
      reconcile its capitalized sink names (`Shell.exec`) with the wired lowercase value-state list (VD-4).
- [ ] **VD-1 (MAJOR): case-drift fail-open.** `SINK_REQUIREMENTS`/`isGovernedSink` (`value-state-checker.ts:179+`)
      hardlist **lowercase-exact** (`match:"exact"`), so tainted `req.body → Shell.exec(x)` PASSES+signs while
      `shell.exec(x)` fires `FUNGI-VALUESTATE-003`. Case-normalize / single-source the sink match.
- [ ] **GNG-03 (BLOCKER): `privacy { deny protected X to response.body }` is purely DECLARATIVE — enforces
      NOTHING** (a raw `protected` PII return admits; the terser `response{denies}` IS enforced). Resolve the
      declared deny against the typed flow, or reject the block as unimplemented — never silently accept a
      security directive that does nothing. (This is the SOUND backstop `.gate` posture-B defers to.)
- [ ] **L4-F1 (BLOCKER): make the production verdict non-suppressible from source.** `// galerina-disable`
      silences any fail-closed gate at `build --production`; `galerina.check.json "rules":{…:"off"}` (L4-F2)
      silences secret-exfil at `--strict`. `build --production` must honour (not bypass) the config and be
      ≥ `--strict` (GNG-04 `check --strict` is currently WEAKER than production; FUNGI-VER-001/002 bypass).
- [ ] **L6-B2 (BLOCKER): coverage-of-coverage.** SEC-002 exercises each gate via its UNIT call, so it CANNOT
      see an UN-WIRED pass (why GNG-01 hid). Add a **wiring-mutant** class: re-hole a gate AND assert a
      **CLI-level** probe kills it (not just a unit call).
- [ ] **VD-2 (MAJOR): single-source the hand lists.** `leak-proof.ts` CAPABILITY_RE drifted from
      `CANONICAL_EFFECTS` (missing `telemetry`/`eval`; stale `file/http/…`) → a real leak bakes
      `capability:"unknown"` into the **signed TestWitness**. Derive CAPABILITY_RE + both sink registries from
      one canonical source; add `audit-sink-canonicality.mjs` + a CAPABILITY_RE canonicality check.
- [ ] SOUND (credit, no action): lexer ASCII-frozen (better than `.gate`), secret→net egress blocked (for the
      hardlisted sinks only — see RD-0234b), C1–C10 closed, 23 SEC-002 mutants kill.

### RD-0234b — second-pass hunt (2026-07-02): ~10 MORE confirmed fail-opens, CROSS-VALIDATED by two independent 12–14-agent hunts. Same disease, wider surface. Owner-gated; prod read-only. They cluster into 4 STRUCTURAL classes — fix the class, not each instance:
- [ ] **CLASS A — MORE dead/unwired gates (like GNG-01).** (i) **Monkey-patch gate `FUNGI-SEC-020/021`**
      (`checkMonkeyPatching`/`…Source`) is imported+re-exported+unit-tested but has **zero pipeline call-sites**
      → `Runtime.patch(...)`/`adapter.override(...)` builds `--production` clean **+ signs** (BLOCKER, both
      hunts). (ii) `checkProductionReadiness`/`PRODUCTION_BLOCKERS` (production-check.ts:70) **never called** —
      the named blocker list is inert; production gates only on `error`-count. (iii) bundled `galerina.mjs`
      never runs the `FUNGI-NAME-001` symbol-resolution gate → signs a hybrid manifest. **Fix:** wire every
      declared gate + a **coverage-of-coverage** test asserting each `PRODUCTION_BLOCKER` code is emitted by a
      WIRED pass at the CLI level (the L6-B2 wiring-mutant class).
- [ ] **CLASS B — signing boundary incomplete across MODES & CLIs (CG-4 class).** (i) **`build --deterministic`
      skips `verifyGovernance` entirely** and mints a signed `.lmanifest` for `FUNGI-GOV-003` leaks /
      `VAL-001/002` / `TENANT-002` IDOR / `CRYPTO-PQ-001` that `build --production` refuses (BLOCKER, both hunts;
      root: `cli.ts:486` gates governance to production-only, the 07-01 strict-recompute to plain-`build`-only,
      deterministic falls through both). (ii) **`GALERINA_PROFILE=production galerina fuse --allow-unsigned`
      admits an UNSIGNED package** — the posture-derived `requireSignature` fail-secure override is dead code
      (MAJOR). **Fix:** ONE signing/admission gate running the FULL production gate set for EVERY
      manifest-emitting mode (production/deterministic/package) and BOTH CLIs, + posture override live.
- [ ] **CLASS C — sink/egress hand-list drift + partial enforcement.** (i) `isNetworkSink`
      (value-state-checker.ts:312) omits prelude egress services `NotificationService`/`PaymentService` → raw
      vault `SecureString` exfiltrated off-host, signed (`FUNGI-SECRET-002` fail-open — RD-0234 had called this
      SOUND; it's sound only for the hardlisted receivers). (ii) `FUNGI-VALUESTATE-006` protected-PII sink guard
      fires at **`AuditLog.write` only** — protected PII via `http.post`/`EmailService` egresses clean (MAJOR).
      (iii) `FUNGI-PASSPORT-002`/`AFFINE-001` skipped for any **non-bare-identifier** sink arg (record/interp
      wrapper mints a signed manifest). **Fix:** single-source the sink/egress lists; enforce at ALL sinks.
- [ ] **CLASS D — parse-time governance ESCAPE HATCH (worst).** `@experimental_profile(...) { … }` — and any
      `@name { }` attribute directive — has its wrapped block **erased from the AST** by `skipBalancedBraces`
      BEFORE any checker runs → secret-exfil / `eval` / undeclared-effect inside it is unconditionally invisible
      and the file signs (BLOCKER, both hunts). **Fix:** attribute directives must NOT drop governed code;
      reject unknown attributes (unknown ⇒ REJECT).
- [ ] **CLASS E (adjacent) — fuse ACL self-assertion.** `build --package` signs the capability ACL from
      `package.fungi.json` **verbatim, with zero reconciliation** against the flows' proven effects (MAJOR).
      **Fix:** derive/verify the fuse ACL from the compiled effects, don't trust the declared JSON.
> Full detail + repros + cross-validation: `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-rd-0234b-fungi-second-pass-hunt.md`.
> **The systemic takeaway:** `.fungi`'s `build --production` green is NOT a guarantee across ~29 findings
> (19 RD-0234 + ~10 here) in ~5 classes — and this is the SOUND backstop `.gate` posture-B defers to. The
> single highest-leverage prod-security work in the project is wiring + unifying these gates. **[DONE 2026-07-02.]**

## 🔒 RUNTIME SECURITY — RD-0236 — ✅ 11/11 FIXED + RED-benched (#1/#3/#6–#11 committed `a927e4b`; #2/#4/#5 done this session, UNCOMMITTED — gates green)
> `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-rd-0236-runtime-50yr-mistake-audit.md` — 11 reproduced runtime governance
> fail-opens, SAME disease as RD-0234 on the RUNTIME surface. Owner greenlit "fix all 11, RED-benched" (2026-07-02);
> **11 fixed**, each RED-benched, full suite green, across 4 packages (tower-citizen · compiler · tri-pipe · app-kernel).

**Fixed (RED-benched):**
- [x] **#1 forgeable capability mask** — `grantedCapabilityMask` is a real JS `#private` field (was `private
      readonly` — erased at runtime → forgeable via `engine.grantedCapabilityMask = 0xFFFF`). `hybrid-engine.ts`.
      **Follow-on ✅ DONE (fail-secure INVERSION, owner posture 2026-07-02):** authority is now DENY-BY-DEFAULT (mask
      0); real authority comes ONLY from a `signedCapabilityGrant` that verifies against the attestation policy for the
      engine's id (`capability-grant.ts`, Ed25519+ML-DSA-65, own domain-separation context; `resolveCapabilityGrant`
      async+cached), or via the audited `allowUnsignedCapabilityGrant` opt-in. RED-benched (deny-by-default · signed
      grant admits · opt-in restores · wrong-key/wrong-engineId refused). **Follow-on² ✅ DONE (`8ce1e93`):** certified mode
      FORBIDS `allowUnsignedCapabilityGrant` (`createHybridEngine` throws `ERR_CERTIFIED_UNSIGNED_CAP_FORBIDDEN`; constructor
      also forces it inert) — certified authority requires a signed grant. The two certified test files now confer authority
      via a hybrid-signed grant; +2 RED-benches (forbid-at-construction, deny-by-default-no-grant).
- [x] **#3 `checkTransition`** — an unknown `requires` is rejected at LOAD (FUNGI-GOV-TPL-001) + denied at check
      (`defaultAction` wired, was dead). `governance-enforcer.ts`.
- [x] **#6 execution-router** — validates the DISPATCHED `decision.target`, not the declared lane; a noisy-only grant
      dispatched to photonic ⇒ denied-to-digital. `tri-pipe/execution-router.ts`.
- [x] **#7 fuse `--allow-unsigned`** refused under `GALERINA_PROFILE=production` (done earlier this session).
- [x] **#8 revocation** — consulted whenever a manifest ASSERTS a keyId (removed the `signature==="verified"`
      precondition); a revoked key on the degrade-to-unsigned path is refused. `app-kernel/fuse-loader.ts`.
- [x] **#9 `canAccess`** — enumerate-safe/default-deny (owner granted; unknown/foreign/empty denied); the
      fail-open-asserting test was deleted. `compiler/runtime/governedMemory.ts`.
- [x] **#10 `tower-runtime.load`** — refuses metadata with an unverifiable artifactHash/engineId (FUNGI-ASSIMILATE-003).
      **Follow-on ✅ DONE (fail-secure INVERSION, owner posture 2026-07-02):** `load()` now (a) ALWAYS verifies
      hash-vs-bytes when artifact bytes are supplied (`FUNGI-ASSIMILATE-004`), and (b) is DENY-BY-DEFAULT for the
      signed-manifest check — a plugin must present a `signedManifest` (new `plugin-manifest.ts`: Ed25519+ML-DSA-65,
      own domain-separation context) that verifies against the tower's `attestationPolicy` AND binds to the metadata's
      engineId+artifactHash (no cross-plugin replay), unless the `allowUnsignedLoad` opt-in selects the floor. The
      engine + `ext-bridge-bitnet` self-load their OWN hardcoded descriptor, so their internal towers opt into the
      floor (self-load is bootstrap, not external-plugin admission). RED-benched. **Follow-on² ✅ PARTIAL (`8ce1e93`):**
      a CERTIFIED `TowerRuntime` now FORBIDS `allowUnsignedLoad` (throws `ERR_CERTIFIED_UNSIGNED_LOAD_FORBIDDEN`) — every
      external certified load needs a verifying signed manifest; +1 RED-bench. RESIDUAL: signing the engine/bridge OWN
      self-descriptor to drop the bootstrap self-load exemption entirely = committed-pubkey custody (LATER).
- [x] **#11 `requireCertifiedProfile`** — forces `requireSigned` when certified (mirrors bridge-attestation). `compiler/wasm-runtime.ts`.

**#2/#4/#5 — owner DECIDED: INVERT the default to fail-secure (2026-07-02). ✅ DONE this session (UNCOMMITTED; NO push — HOLD): source + inverted tests + RED-benches + downstream fixes; full suite 60/60 (5,954 tests) + phase-close ALL green, `governance:diff` NEUTRAL.**
> All three had the shape "ABSENCE of an explicit grant ⇒ ADMIT (permissive default)". Owner chose the most-secure
> path: invert to "absence ⇒ DENY", with an explicit **audited opt-IN flag** per finding on the `AiGovernance`
> interface (default `false` = secure). Implemented in `galerina-tower-citizen/src/hybrid-engine.ts`:
- [x] **#2 source** — `checkBridgeAttestation`: a `null` attestationPolicy with ≥1 registered bridge now DENIES
      (`ERR_BRIDGE_UNATTESTED`) unless `allowUnattestedBridges === true`. An EMPTY registry with no policy stays fine.
- [x] **#4 source** — host-native fallback is DENY-BY-DEFAULT: any denied technique traps `ERR_HOST_NATIVE_DENIED`
      unless `allowHostNativeFallback === true`. Certified / `denyHostNativeFallback` still FORCE the deny.
- [x] **#5 source** — a request that NAMES a model with no `ai{}` allow-list is DENIED (`ERR_AI_MODEL_NOT_APPROVED`)
      unless `allowUnlistedModels === true`. A request naming no model is unaffected.
- [x] **tests inverted + RED-benched** — the tower-citizen permissive-default tests now pass the minimal opt-in
      flags (per-plan: default plan needs `allowUnattestedBridges`+`allowHostNativeFallback`; feedforward-only needs
      just `allowUnattestedBridges`; a named model with no allow-list adds `allowUnlistedModels`). Three RED-benches
      added to `rd0236-runtime-hardening.test.mjs` (each asserts the DEFAULT DENIES **and** the opt-in restores the
      path — no over-blocking). Two permissive-default assertions (`bridge-attestation` back-compat, `governance-hardening`
      host-native) were rewritten as paired deny-by-default + opt-in-restores benches.
- [x] **downstream blast radius (fix the CLASS)** — the inversion also reddened two CONSUMERS of the hybrid engine:
      `galerina-ext-bridge-cpp` (cpp BitNet registry unattested) and `galerina-tri-pipe` (tier-routing over stub/emulator
      registries). Fixed both by opting in; `tri-pipe` needed a small behaviour-preserving SOURCE passthrough
      (`TriPipeOptions.governance` → forwarded to `createHybridEngine`, since the wrapper couldn't express `ai{}`
      governance at all). Also fixed a **masked** vacuous pass in the cpp determinism-oracle test (both sides had been
      trapping to checksum 0 → `0===0`).
- [x] **GREEN-gated** — `run-all-tests.cjs` = 60/60 packages · 5,954 tests · 0 fail; `run-phase-close.mjs` = ALL gates
      green, `governance:diff` **NEUTRAL — no authority widening**. Commit PENDING with explicit pathspecs (NO push — HOLD).
      Folds in the `type-registry.ts` VD-2 SoT refactor.

## ✅ `.gate` — UNLOCKED + hardened 2026-07-02 (owner PROMPT-main-session-gate-integration.md)
> Naming corrected: `.gate` = light-ASCII AI app-authoring language (draw-don't-code); graph/GIR = the one
> ordinary-graph IR; **NO `.graph` language**. Pipeline `.fungi`+`.gate` → GIR → WASM; sign the IR; deny-only.
> Owner ODs answered: ZT-1 dual-SoT machine-source · one `:cut` form (`@redact` removed) · XOR basename +
> cross-calls · delete 8 old JSON-IR examples. Checker → v0.4. **Adversarial re-audit loop rounds 4–8 closed
> 16 real holes** (self-test 94→129, corpus 21/21) — KB `galerina-rd-0232d-gate-checker-rounds-4-7-hardening.md`.
> **Privacy posture DECIDED = B** (RD-0232d): un-named-egress → loud INTERIM warning + defer sound verdict to
> compile-time `FUNGI-PRIVACY-002` (which RD-0234 GNG-03/GNG-01 shows is currently dead — see above).
- [ ] **`.gate` build gate — OWNER DECISION (re-scope D5).** Adversarial rounds 4→9 closed **~20 real holes**
      (self-test 94→135, corpus 21/21, posture-B), but the loop is **ASYMPTOTIC**: each round after a "green"
      checker finds a NEW enumeration gap (source/egress omitted, suppressor position, walk-prune) because a
      TOPOLOGICAL pre-filter approximates a typed field-level dataflow analysis — it will never be "provably
      empty". **Recommendation (RD-0232d):** ship the checker as the hardened best-effort **authoring lint** it
      is (incomplete-enumeration limit documented) and gate `.gate` COMPILER integration on the **SOUND layer**
      — the signed capability at fuse + a WIRED compile-time `FUNGI-PRIVACY-002` (currently DEAD per RD-0234
      GNG-01/03; see the 🔒 SECURITY section — this is the shared convergence path for BOTH `.gate` and
      `.fungi`). Change D5 from "re-audit EMPTY" → "documented necessary-not-sufficient lint + sound backstop
      wired+tested". **Until the owner accepts the re-scope, D5 stays RED and no `.gate` compiler is built.**
- [ ] **`.gate` §5a–5d integration** (blocked on the D5 re-scope above): NEW separate `.gate` discovery at the
      app layer only; lower via in-memory GIR; reuse shipped governance; + the **8 negative tests** proving the
      hard locks.
- [ ] `.graph` A/B fair re-run — paused-coupled; `.graph` = ASCII Topology ONLY (never a language).
