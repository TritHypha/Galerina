# TODO

Living task list. Authoritative forward view: `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-roadmap.md`.
% audit: `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-percent-audit-roadmap-2026-07-02.md` (**~90% shippable / ~64% full-vision**).
Consistency rules + gates: `docs/CONSISTENCY_GATES.md`.

**State (2026-07-02, verified by running):** 60/60 packages · 5,914 tests · 0 fail · phase-close ALL green ·
`audit-effect-canonicality --strict` 0 findings · `governance:diff` NEUTRAL · border 93/0. `main` **ahead 5, NOT pushed**.

## ✅ Done — 2026-07-01/02 (local, unpushed)
- [x] governance:diff fixture noise — gitignored `build/*.fungi` no longer phantom "added" — `941ec41`
- [x] **CG-7** annotation→re-fuse→unsigned cascade closed (both ends + detector) — `4190287`
- [x] **Declared-effect hardening** — `telemetry.read` canonical (bit 14) · `ai.infer`→alias · `eval.execute`
      DENY-ONLY (`FUNGI-EFFECT-006`, every profile) · Stage-B reconciled (C9 cleared) · C10 — `6bb63a1`
- [x] **CG-4 at the bundled CLI** — lenient build no longer mints a signed manifest for a production-violating
      artifact (was proven still hybrid-signing `effects{totally.fake.effect}`) — `2491de9`
- [x] **CG-6 corpus gate** — teaching corpus may declare only production-compilable effect names — `eb525e5`
- [x] **% audit + roadmap refresh (2026-07-02)** — 6-subsystem fleet audit + critic; new percent-audit doc,
      hub roadmap, runtime SOT banner; **fixed the anti-drift registry's own drift** in `docs/CONSISTENCY_GATES.md`
      (C9 reconciliation + V_DPM bits 20–23 were shipped but still listed pending).
- [x] **NUL-byte fix (owner-approved 2026-07-02)** — raw `0x00` in `kernel.ts` (admission kernel) +
      `inference-bridge-contract/src/manifest.ts` replaced with the byte-identical `\0` escape; both files
      are plain greppable text again; `source-hygiene-no-nul.test.mjs` allowlist now **EMPTY** (zero-tolerance).
- [x] **CG-7 third end (owner-approved 2026-07-02)** — direct `galerina build --package <pkg>` refuses when the
      manifest is **git-tracked** real-signed (committed ceremony fixture: greeting, fuse-demo, 2 compose
      fixtures) unless `--force`; untracked dev-signed manifests (api-protocol-rest's own tests) build freely;
      not-a-repo → protect. `rebuild-fusable-packages --force` forwards to the child. +2 regression tests.

## 🔲 Owner decisions (answered 2026-07-02 / still open)
- [x] ~~Domain-effect namespaces~~ — **DECIDED: keep-interim.** Aerospace allowlist stands WARN-level; any NEW
      invented name still blocks; posture A stays buildable later behind an explicit GO (verdict + N1–N4 proof
      recorded in the KB note).
- [ ] **Push** the local commits to `origin/main` — **owner chose HOLD (2026-07-02)**; stays local until an
      explicit push OK. Until pushed, remote CI is blind to CG-4/CG-6/CG-7.
- [ ] Offline re-sign ceremony owed: `greeting.lmanifest` (old-brand `lln.manifest.v1` schema).

## 🔲 NOW (buildable, no hard blocker; value-ordered)
- [ ] **Numeric doc-drift sweep** — stale comments say "64-bit not yet emitted" while the gate set is empty:
      `value-state-checker.ts:2166`, `u64-arith.ts:25`, `numeric-lowering.ts:26`, `cli-numeric-gate.test.mjs`
      header. Then extend `audit-doc-drift`/`diagnostic-doc-drift` to catch the "gated/not-yet-emitted" phrase
      class (error→tooling rule) so it can't recur.
- [ ] **`FUNGI-LIMIT-001`** — implement the `enforced_limits{}` ceiling check (`governance-verifier.ts:2694-2699`
      emits no diagnostic today; a declared-but-unenforced governance surface).
- [ ] **B5a signed registry index** — module is real + fail-closed *when injected* (`fuse-loader.ts:694/951`),
      but no signed index is distributed and nothing wires it by default. Make default-on or ship an index.
- [ ] Drive the `lint:conventions` umbrella (270 report-only findings) to 0, then drop `--soft`.

## 🔒 SECURITY — `.fungi` prod audit RD-0234/0234b — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-02 (owner greenlit "fix everything"; build-staging, RED-benched, NOT pushed)
> The ~29 fail-opens are FIXED behind ONE shared production security gate `runProductionSecurityGate`
> (`galerina-core-compiler/src/security-gate.ts`) that EVERY manifest-emitting path now clears before signing —
> both CLIs (`cli.ts` + bundled `galerina.mjs`), all modes (build / --production / --deterministic / --package).
> Each fix was RED-repro'd on the real CLI first; full suite **60/60 · 5,914+ · 0 fail**; a coverage-of-coverage
> test pins the wiring so a checker can no longer silently un-wire. New codes registered (FUNGI-ATTR-001/002,
> FUNGI-BUILD-002, FUNGI-PRIVACY-001 now ENFORCED).

**Resolved (fix → code):**
- [x] **Class A — dead gates WIRED**: `checkTaint` (GNG-01), `checkMonkeyPatching`+Source (SEC-020/021),
      bundled-CLI `resolveSymbols`/FUNGI-NAME-001, `checkProductionReadiness`→FUNGI-BUILD-002. In the main
      pipeline + the shared gate (`security-gate.ts`, `cli.ts`, `galerina.mjs`).
- [x] **Class B — signing boundary UNIFIED**: `build --deterministic` runs governance + the full gate; the
      bundled signing CLI runs the complete gate in EVERY profile; `fuse --allow-unsigned` refused under
      `GALERINA_PROFILE=production` (posture override live → FUNGI-FUSE-UNSIGNED-DENIED). **cli.ts + galerina.mjs
      both sign behind the SAME `runProductionSecurityGate`.**
- [x] **Class C / VD-1**: VD-1 case-insensitive sink match (`getSinkRequirement`); `isNetworkSink` covers
      NotificationService/PaymentService; VALUESTATE-006 protected-PII guard extended to network egress (was
      AuditLog.write only); PASSPORT-002/AFFINE-001 recurse into wrapped (record/interp) args.
- [x] **Class D — parse-time escape hatch CLOSED**: new `attribute-checker.ts` (FUNGI-ATTR-001/002) — an
      attribute directive wrapping code, or an unknown `@name`, is deny-by-default. RED→GREEN on the real CLI.
- [x] **GNG-03 / FUNGI-PRIVACY-001 ENFORCED**: `privacy { deny protected X to response.body }` resolved against
      the flow return (`governance-verifier.ts`), honouring redact/seal. Was PLANNED-Phase-10C+, now ENFORCED.
- [x] **L4-F1/F2 — verdict non-suppressible**: under build --production/--deterministic/check --strict a
      `// galerina-disable` / check.json `"off"` cannot silence a fail-closed ERROR (`cli.ts`). check --strict ≥ prod.
- [x] **L6-B2 — coverage-of-coverage**: `tests/security-gate-coverage.test.mjs` feeds a violating fixture per
      gated checker through the SHARED gate; cli.ts now CALLS the gate (was hand-re-enumerating — the drift the
      ZT-tooling audit caught).
- [x] **VD-2 (partial)**: `leak-proof.ts` CAPABILITY_RE gained the missing `telemetry`/`eval` namespaces.

**Resolved after owner decisions (2026-07-02):**
- [x] **Class E — fuse ACL reconciliation** (owner: "verify caps ⊇ proven effects"). `build --package` now
      refuses to sign when a flow performs an effect the declared `capabilities` doesn't cover
      (FUNGI-FUSE-ACL-UNDERDECLARED, deny-by-default; `galerina.mjs`). Pure packages pass trivially
      (api-protocol-rest = all pure flows); signed-fixture-guard 7/7; verified on an under-declaring probe.
- [x] **getPatient.fungi** (owner: "redact + retype"). PatientSummary.patientId → `redacted String`; response
      returns `redact(patientId)` — honours its own `deny protected PatientId to response.body`. FUNGI-PRIVACY-001
      count now 0 (was 1).

**Residual (NOW item):**
- [ ] **VD-2 (full single-source)** — derive CAPABILITY_RE + the sink registries from ONE canonical source
      (export CANONICAL_EFFECTS); `scripts/audit-sink-canonicality.mjs` now guards drift in the interim.
- [ ] **`.gate` front-end compiler** (PROMPT §5a-5d) — build gate GREEN (D5 re-scoped), backstop wired →
      UNBLOCKED. Owner chose a DEDICATED session (large feature; hard locks demand care). Next chunk.

### RD-0234 — `.fungi` prod audit (owner-gated fixes; prod read-only; build-staging; RED-bench-first)
> `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-rd-0234-fungi-50yr-mistake-audit.md` — 19 confirmed, 0 false; **`.fungi`
> shares `.gate`'s core disease: a passing `build --production` does NOT currently mean the file honours its
> guarantees.** GNG-01 + VD-1 **re-verified live on prod 2026-07-02** (root-cause below). These are the
> highest-severity items in this file — a dead security pass mints SIGNED manifests for SQLi. All fixes
> owner-gated (prod). Fix each behind a RED-bench (repro test) first.
- [ ] **GNG-01 (BLOCKER): wire the DEAD OWASP taint pass.** `checkTaint` is imported (`index.ts:807`) + defined
      (`taint-checker.ts:264`) but has **ZERO call sites** — SQLi/shell/XSS from `request` input builds
      `--production` clean **+ mints a signed `.lmanifest`**. Invoke `checkTaint` in the compile/CLI pipeline;
      reconcile its capitalized sink names (`Shell.exec`) with the wired lowercase value-state list (VD-4).
- [ ] **VD-1 (MAJOR): case-drift fail-open.** `SINK_REQUIREMENTS`/`isGovernedSink` (`value-state-checker.ts:179+`)
      hardlist **lowercase-exact** (`match:"exact"`), so tainted `req.body → Shell.exec(x)` PASSES+signs while
      `shell.exec(x)` fires `FUNGI-VALUESTATE-003`. Case-normalize / single-source the sink match.
- [ ] **GNG-03 (BLOCKER): `privacy { deny protected X to response.body }` is purely DECLARATIVE — enforces
      NOTHING** (a raw `protected` PII return admits; the terser `response{denies}` IS enforced). Resolve the
      declared deny against the typed flow, or reject the block as unimplemented — never silently accept a
      security directive that does nothing. (This is the SOUND backstop `.gate` posture-B defers to.)
- [ ] **L4-F1 (BLOCKER): make the production verdict non-suppressible from source.** `// galerina-disable`
      silences any fail-closed gate at `build --production`; `galerina.check.json "rules":{…:"off"}` (L4-F2)
      silences secret-exfil at `--strict`. `build --production` must honour (not bypass) the config and be
      ≥ `--strict` (GNG-04 `check --strict` is currently WEAKER than production; FUNGI-VER-001/002 bypass).
- [ ] **L6-B2 (BLOCKER): coverage-of-coverage.** SEC-002 exercises each gate via its UNIT call, so it CANNOT
      see an UN-WIRED pass (why GNG-01 hid). Add a **wiring-mutant** class: re-hole a gate AND assert a
      **CLI-level** probe kills it (not just a unit call).
- [ ] **VD-2 (MAJOR): single-source the hand lists.** `leak-proof.ts` CAPABILITY_RE drifted from
      `CANONICAL_EFFECTS` (missing `telemetry`/`eval`; stale `file/http/…`) → a real leak bakes
      `capability:"unknown"` into the **signed TestWitness**. Derive CAPABILITY_RE + both sink registries from
      one canonical source; add `audit-sink-canonicality.mjs` + a CAPABILITY_RE canonicality check.
- [ ] SOUND (credit, no action): lexer ASCII-frozen (better than `.gate`), secret→net egress blocked (for the
      hardlisted sinks only — see RD-0234b), C1–C10 closed, 23 SEC-002 mutants kill.

### RD-0234b — second-pass hunt (2026-07-02): ~10 MORE confirmed fail-opens, CROSS-VALIDATED by two independent 12–14-agent hunts. Same disease, wider surface. Owner-gated; prod read-only. They cluster into 4 STRUCTURAL classes — fix the class, not each instance:
- [ ] **CLASS A — MORE dead/unwired gates (like GNG-01).** (i) **Monkey-patch gate `FUNGI-SEC-020/021`**
      (`checkMonkeyPatching`/`…Source`) is imported+re-exported+unit-tested but has **zero pipeline call-sites**
      → `Runtime.patch(...)`/`adapter.override(...)` builds `--production` clean **+ signs** (BLOCKER, both
      hunts). (ii) `checkProductionReadiness`/`PRODUCTION_BLOCKERS` (production-check.ts:70) **never called** —
      the named blocker list is inert; production gates only on `error`-count. (iii) bundled `galerina.mjs`
      never runs the `FUNGI-NAME-001` symbol-resolution gate → signs a hybrid manifest. **Fix:** wire every
      declared gate + a **coverage-of-coverage** test asserting each `PRODUCTION_BLOCKER` code is emitted by a
      WIRED pass at the CLI level (the L6-B2 wiring-mutant class).
- [ ] **CLASS B — signing boundary incomplete across MODES & CLIs (CG-4 class).** (i) **`build --deterministic`
      skips `verifyGovernance` entirely** and mints a signed `.lmanifest` for `FUNGI-GOV-003` leaks /
      `VAL-001/002` / `TENANT-002` IDOR / `CRYPTO-PQ-001` that `build --production` refuses (BLOCKER, both hunts;
      root: `cli.ts:486` gates governance to production-only, the 07-01 strict-recompute to plain-`build`-only,
      deterministic falls through both). (ii) **`GALERINA_PROFILE=production galerina fuse --allow-unsigned`
      admits an UNSIGNED package** — the posture-derived `requireSignature` fail-secure override is dead code
      (MAJOR). **Fix:** ONE signing/admission gate running the FULL production gate set for EVERY
      manifest-emitting mode (production/deterministic/package) and BOTH CLIs, + posture override live.
- [ ] **CLASS C — sink/egress hand-list drift + partial enforcement.** (i) `isNetworkSink`
      (value-state-checker.ts:312) omits prelude egress services `NotificationService`/`PaymentService` → raw
      vault `SecureString` exfiltrated off-host, signed (`FUNGI-SECRET-002` fail-open — RD-0234 had called this
      SOUND; it's sound only for the hardlisted receivers). (ii) `FUNGI-VALUESTATE-006` protected-PII sink guard
      fires at **`AuditLog.write` only** — protected PII via `http.post`/`EmailService` egresses clean (MAJOR).
      (iii) `FUNGI-PASSPORT-002`/`AFFINE-001` skipped for any **non-bare-identifier** sink arg (record/interp
      wrapper mints a signed manifest). **Fix:** single-source the sink/egress lists; enforce at ALL sinks.
- [ ] **CLASS D — parse-time governance ESCAPE HATCH (worst).** `@experimental_profile(...) { … }` — and any
      `@name { }` attribute directive — has its wrapped block **erased from the AST** by `skipBalancedBraces`
      BEFORE any checker runs → secret-exfil / `eval` / undeclared-effect inside it is unconditionally invisible
      and the file signs (BLOCKER, both hunts). **Fix:** attribute directives must NOT drop governed code;
      reject unknown attributes (unknown ⇒ REJECT).
- [ ] **CLASS E (adjacent) — fuse ACL self-assertion.** `build --package` signs the capability ACL from
      `package.fungi.json` **verbatim, with zero reconciliation** against the flows' proven effects (MAJOR).
      **Fix:** derive/verify the fuse ACL from the compiled effects, don't trust the declared JSON.
> Full detail + repros + cross-validation: `../ZTF-Knowledge-Bases/galerina-rd-0234b-fungi-second-pass-hunt.md`.
> **The systemic takeaway:** `.fungi`'s `build --production` green is NOT a guarantee across ~29 findings
> (19 RD-0234 + ~10 here) in ~5 classes — and this is the SOUND backstop `.gate` posture-B defers to. The
> single highest-leverage prod-security work in the project is wiring + unifying these gates. **[DONE 2026-07-02.]**

## ✅ `.gate` — UNLOCKED + hardened 2026-07-02 (owner PROMPT-main-session-gate-integration.md)
> Naming corrected: `.gate` = light-ASCII AI app-authoring language (draw-don't-code); graph/GIR = the one
> ordinary-graph IR; **NO `.graph` language**. Pipeline `.fungi`+`.gate` → GIR → WASM; sign the IR; deny-only.
> Owner ODs answered: ZT-1 dual-SoT machine-source · one `:cut` form (`@redact` removed) · XOR basename +
> cross-calls · delete 8 old JSON-IR examples. Checker → v0.4. **Adversarial re-audit loop rounds 4–8 closed
> 16 real holes** (self-test 94→129, corpus 21/21) — KB `galerina-rd-0232d-gate-checker-rounds-4-7-hardening.md`.
> **Privacy posture DECIDED = B** (RD-0232d): un-named-egress → loud INTERIM warning + defer sound verdict to
> compile-time `FUNGI-PRIVACY-002` (which RD-0234 GNG-03/GNG-01 shows is currently dead — see above).
- [ ] **`.gate` build gate — OWNER DECISION (re-scope D5).** Adversarial rounds 4→9 closed **~20 real holes**
      (self-test 94→135, corpus 21/21, posture-B), but the loop is **ASYMPTOTIC**: each round after a "green"
      checker finds a NEW enumeration gap (source/egress omitted, suppressor position, walk-prune) because a
      TOPOLOGICAL pre-filter approximates a typed field-level dataflow analysis — it will never be "provably
      empty". **Recommendation (RD-0232d):** ship the checker as the hardened best-effort **authoring lint** it
      is (incomplete-enumeration limit documented) and gate `.gate` COMPILER integration on the **SOUND layer**
      — the signed capability at fuse + a WIRED compile-time `FUNGI-PRIVACY-002` (currently DEAD per RD-0234
      GNG-01/03; see the 🔒 SECURITY section — this is the shared convergence path for BOTH `.gate` and
      `.fungi`). Change D5 from "re-audit EMPTY" → "documented necessary-not-sufficient lint + sound backstop
      wired+tested". **Until the owner accepts the re-scope, D5 stays RED and no `.gate` compiler is built.**
- [ ] **`.gate` §5a–5d integration** (blocked on the D5 re-scope above): NEW separate `.gate` discovery at the
      app layer only; lower via in-memory GIR; reuse shipped governance; + the **8 negative tests** proving the
      hard locks.
- [ ] `.graph` A/B fair re-run — paused-coupled; `.graph` = ASCII Topology ONLY (never a language).
